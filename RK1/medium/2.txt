Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon, one of the most influential rock albums of all time, has turned 50. The psychedelic masterpiece, a meditation on the pressures of modern life, peaked at No. 1 then stayed on Billboard’s top albums chart for another 14 years. This week also marks the 60th anniversary of Please, Please Me, the first album released by the Beatles. Coincidentally, 1963 was the year another chart-topping musician was born: Whitney Houston holds the record for the most consecutive No. 1 singles, and her 1992 soundtrack for The Bodyguard remains the top-selling album by a female artist.
